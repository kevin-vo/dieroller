## Overview

`"dieroller"` is a minimal [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package 
that provides functions to simulate rolling a die.

* `die()` creates a coin object (of class `"die"`)
* `roll()` tosses a coin object, producing a `"roll"` object.
* `plot()` method for a `"roll"` object to plot frequencies of a series of rolls.
* `summary()` method for a `"roll"` object.


## Motivation

This package has been developed to illustrate some of the concepts
behind the creation of an R package.


## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub via the package `"devtools"`:

```r
# development version from GitHub:
#install.packages("devtools") 

# install "dieroller" (without vignettes)
devtools::install_github("kevin-vo/dieroller")

# install "dieroller" (with vignettes)
devtools::install_github("kevin-vo/dieroller", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Usage

```{r}
library(dieroller)

# default die
die1 <- die()
die1

# 1 roll of die1
roll(die1)

# 10 rolls of die1
roll10 <- roll(die1, times = 10)
roll10

# summary
summary(roll10)


# 100 rolls
roll100 <- roll(die1, times = 100)

# summary
summary(roll100)
```
